<h1>Bracket Breakdown: Who Pays How Much?</h1>

<h3>Most Americans hold strong opinions about the tax system. Some Republicans think that a flat tax of about 10% across all tax brackets is most fair. Many Social Democrats would like to see increased tax rates and a new annual wealth tax on a person's networth. Then there are people around the middle who have mixed opinions about the current system, but don't want any drastic change.
    <br><br>
Athough many people hold such strong views, most people do not know the true numbers that each tax bracket brings in and then pays back in taxes. This website seeks to present what the figures actually look like so more people can be informed. This website does not endorse any particular view.</h3>
