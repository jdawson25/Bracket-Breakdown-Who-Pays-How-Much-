    <h6>In New York City...
    <ul>
      <li>There are 49 zip-codes with a median income between $70,000-$90,000 (tan)</li>
      <li>There are 55 zip-codes with a median income less than $70,000 (red)</li>
      <li>There are 77 zip-codes with a median income greater than $70,000 (green)</li>
    </ul>
      This shows the high wealth inequality because instead of there being a normal distribution with most of the zip-codes having middle median incomes, there are significantly more zip-codes which are on the higher and lower ends of the median income spectrum.<br>
     <br> While the percent of all taxes paid by the lower brackets has decreased, the lower brackets' share of all income has also gone down over time. On the other hand, the top 1% of income earners pay nearly half of all income taxes, but top 1% earners' share of all income has increased by over 3x since 1980. Overall, wealth inequality has increased since 1980 as earners in the top 5% now earn a significantly larger share of all US income and earners below the top 10% now earn a much smaller share of all US income.
